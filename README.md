# AI-webapp
This repo is about building AI features like
`computer vision`,
`Facial Recognition` ,
`Object detection` ,
`Image Classification` 
 by using in the web .

---

`Computer vision` : computer vision can be used in various types of fields From any software project to any hardware project. Comming to this project. The main objectives in this topic are :

`1) Word Detection :` For a given picture the model scans all the words in the picture and understands all the letters in given word and translates them to the user understandable language (This is useful if a person comes to a new place ). The next step is to create an api and the api will be used by the user and is called using any hardware (Like Raspberry pi) so that any robot can work autonomously.

`Object Detection : ` To be able to detect the obstacles and specify its location.

`Facial Recognition : `To be able to detect the faces and to locate them.

`Image Classification : ` To be able to classify the objects in the given image.

There are Two parts in this project...

`Part - 1`

This part 1 aims to generate an api which takes the feed of the user requirements and based on the options selected by the user and the api returns the needed information.( Useful to developers ).Based on the selected options a model should be automatically created and will be given to the user for deployment.so that a user could use them in their respective projects.

`Part - 2`

This part is more on the usage of common people. A webapp which contains many models which are aldready deployed , the user can use the  functionalities of the trained model by calling them usiing a proper GUI.

` Example - 1 `

Suppose text detection was selected by the user , then when he opens his camera then the model should be able to identify the text embedded in it and display it to the user. Like if the user is in a new place and could not understand the text written on the city then he could use this model to understand the text embedded in the photo.

The folder `Templates `contains all the front end related documents...
For this I have added `index.html` page which contains all the frontend part 
and the logic for the backend should be decided .
Also The backend consists of various trained models which are then deployed and used in practice 

---Happy coding---

If you would like to contribute to this project then try to solve the issues
If you are new to open source conteibutions then try to solve good first issues labels
