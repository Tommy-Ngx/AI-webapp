This project aims to generate an api which takes the feed of the user data and based on the options selected by the user api returns the needed information.

`Computer vision` : computer vision can be used in various types of fields From any software project to any hardware project. Comming to this project. The main objectives in this project are :

`1) Word Detection :` From a given picture this api scan all the letters in given word and translates them to the user understandable language (This is useful if a person comes to a new place .). The next step is to use the api which is called via any hardware (Like Raspberry pi) so that any robot can work autonomously using the api.

`Object Detection : ` To be able to detect the obstacles and specify its location.

`Facial Recognition : `To be able to detect the faces and to locate them.

`Image Classification : ` To be able to classify the objects in the given image.

We could able to achieve Facial Recognition and Object Detection with ease if we could able to complete Image classification

The folder `Templates `contains all the front end related documents...
For this I have added `index.html` page which contains all the frontend part 
and the logic for the backend should be decided .
Also The backend consists of various trained models which are then deployed and used  in practice 

---Happy coding---
